# Mathematical modelling of single cell mtDNA population dynamics

## During this project I hope to:

1. Learn how to program using the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/).
1. [Use mathematics to model](https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~madjl/course_text.pdf) [mtDNA](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/mitochondrial-dna) population dynamics in Julia.
1. Present my research in a report and poster at the end.
