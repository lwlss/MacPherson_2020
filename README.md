# Simulating mtDNA Population Dynamics in Patients with Mitochondrial Disease

Project repository for project on mathematical modelling of mtDNA mutations

## In this project I hope to:

1. Learn how to program using the Julia programming language.
1. Use mathematics to model mtDNA population dynamics in Julia.
1. Present my research in a report and poster at the end
1. Learn to like maths.
